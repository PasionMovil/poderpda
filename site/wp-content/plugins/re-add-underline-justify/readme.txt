This tiny plugin re-adds the Editor text underline, text justify and rearrange buttons in the WYSIWYG as they were before WordPress 4.7.


== Description ==

In WordPress 4.7, the core developper team decided to make various changes in the editor (TinyMce WYSIWYG), including removing the **underline and justify buttons** and rearranging some of the toolbar buttons.
If you don't want to change the way you edit your content and/or don't want to confuse your customers with a new contribution interface, this very lightweight plugin will set the editor style back to its previous state (like in WordPress 4.6 and above versions).

**You may change the Editor style from the Writing option page.**

4 options are available for the Editor style :

* Default - without underline & justify buttons
* Re-add underline & justify buttons
* Re-add underline & justify + rearrange
* Re-add justify only (added in 0.1.3)

Please note, the third option is, in my opinion, a good compromise between the 4.6 and 4.7 editor versions. It moves up the style select to the first line and moves the underline button after the other text position buttons.

**IMPORTANT:** Try different options before posting a bug repport. Some plugins like ACF (free version) are using there own list of buttons and can create conflict with this plugin. Option 3 and 4 are best to prevent this plugin from removing your existing buttons.
